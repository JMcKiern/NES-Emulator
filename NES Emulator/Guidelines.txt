TODOs for a class go in the header file above its declaration ALWAYS
	You may refer back to a TODO within the definitions (ie in the *.cpp file)

Headers use #define guards

Do not modify other header files not made by me

Width always comes before height

functions: fooBar();
variables: fooBar;
Members: fooBar;
Methods: FooBar();
Class: FooBar;

in *.cpp gaps after bottom of function only when moving to different catagory

ptr * are on the side of the type (eg int* x; not int *x;)

Methods definitions should be in the same order as their declarations

All default constructors are the ones that would be used in the NES. Any
others may require additional setup before use.
