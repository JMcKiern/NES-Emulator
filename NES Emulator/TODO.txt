Add color options (emphasis, grayscale)
Add ability for swapping of games without having to destroy GamePak?

Mapppers to implement: NROM, UNROM, CNROM, MMC1, MMC3


Bugs
	Sprite hitboxes are 8 pixels (or maybe just 1 tile?) to right in Mario Bros
	Instruction 0xf3c5 = BIT 0x58a9 of Ice Climbers
		This should be invalid since mapper 0 has no expansion rom
